## Branches

### [Server Branch](https://github.com/your-username/tsukumo/tree/Server)

The **Server** branch contains the backend package manager logic and server-side components for handling package storage, management, and client interactions. This branch is crucial for setting up and maintaining the remote repository for the Tsukumo package manager.

### [Client Branch](https://github.com/your-username/tsukumo/tree/Client)

The **Client** branch contains the client-side package manager, which handles the downloading, installation, and management of packages from the server-side repository. This branch is designed for local package management and is meant for developers who want to use Tsukumo to manage their own packages on their local machines.

With Tsukumo's separation into **Server** and **Client** branches, you can manage and deploy both the backend and frontend of your package management system independently.
